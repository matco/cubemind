# Cubemind
A Mastermind-like game for the [Futurocube](http://www.futurocube.com).

## How to run on your cube
1. Download and install the [Futurocube SDK](http://www.futurocube.com/sdk/).
2. Launch SDK and open SDK mode.
3. Select the script ```cubemind.p```, and press "Compile and Upload to FLASH" (the game can not been run from RAM because it uses to much memory).
4. In the console, type ```prunf```.

## How to play
1. When the game starts, the cube will choose a secret code.
2. Choose a side to make your first guess: the blue dot indicate the direction of the secret.
3. Change colors by tapping the side of the cube.
4. Whenever you're ready, double tap the top of the cube so it can check your guess.
5. A red light means that one of your dot is correct in both color and position, a white one means one of your dot has the right color in the wrong position.
6. Find the secret before you fill the cube.
